Context:
From biotechnology.txt: Personalized Medicine

Advances in genomics and biotechnology are enabling personalized medicine approaches where treatments are tailored to individual patients based on their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environment. Pharmacogenomics studies how genetic variations affect drug responses, leading to more effective and safer medications.

Regenerative Medicine

Regenerative medicine focuses on repairing or replacing damaged tissues and organs using stem cells, tissue engineering, and gene therapy. Scientists are developing methods to grow organs in laboratories, use stem cells to treat degenerative diseases, and stimulate the body's natural healing processes.

Bioethics and Regulation

From biotechnology.txt: CRISPR Gene Editing

CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA sequences in living cells. This system, adapted from a natural bacterial defense mechanism, consists of a guide RNA that directs the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA locations where it can cut, delete, or insert genetic material with unprecedented accuracy.

Synthetic Biology

Synthetic biology combines engineering principles with biological systems to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems. Scientists can now program cells to produce medicines, biofuels, and other valuable compounds. This field promises to revolutionize manufacturing by using living organisms as biological factories.

Personalized Medicine

From biotechnology.txt: Bioethics and Regulation

As biotechnology advances rapidly, ethical considerations become increasingly important. Questions arise about genetic privacy, enhancement versus treatment, access to expensive therapies, and the environmental impact of genetically modified organisms. Regulatory frameworks must balance innovation with safety and ethical concerns to ensure responsible development of biotechnological applications.
